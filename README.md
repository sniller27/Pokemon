# Pokemon
Webapplication made in ASP.NET and C# in Visual Studio (webforms).

This project is built on top of the previous C# hand-in branches.
In this application you can sign up for a Pokémon event as a Pokehunter or an Organizer. After sign up your can log in and see other participants for the event, and you can edit your account information if you want.
Furthermore if you are logged in as an organizer, then you can also see the attending organizers as well, and you can see and edit information about everyone.

All data is stored in two binary files.

For the design I have used the Material Design Lite (MDL) CSS-framework.
